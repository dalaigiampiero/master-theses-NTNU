\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank my supervisors, who helped me in refining my research questions, debated critically and constructively about the topic and guided me through the research ethics application. It was an honor working with you.\\
Thanks to the parents who kindly decided to participate in the study with their children. You have all my most sincere gratitude.\\
Thanks to my family, who supported me through my whole education path abroad. Nothing could have been really possible without you.\\
Thanks to my friends in Gj√∏vik and the others scattered all over the world, who kept me motivated in always doing my best. I love you all and I wish you all the best for your future.\\
Thanks to my colleagues at the Alpaca Cooperative, who have always shown me the highest respect as their peer, helping me to strengthen my confidence as a professional and as a researcher. It was a bumpy ride, but we made it.
