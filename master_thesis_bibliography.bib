  abstract = {Estimating mental workload using eye parameters in different fields has become a significant study focus in the area of research. It is vital to discover the most reliable eye parameter/parameters that can be used to estimate mental workload. In this study, N-back tasks with four difficulty levels were designed to induce mental workload for a sample of 21 university students at NTNU Gjøvik. 17 eye parameters were measured using SMI RED250mobile Eye Tracker at a sampling rate of 250 Hz. Analyzed data indicate that peak fixation duration is the most suitable eye parameter to estimate mental workload. It has a negative relationship with the mental workload, where higher peak fixation duration can be observed at lower mental workload and lower peak fixation duration at higher mental workload. Moreover, blink frequency, blink count, peak blink duration, and pupil diameter show a significant positive relationship to the mental workload. Most of the saccade parameters failed to show a significant relationship, while fixation frequency, fixation duration, fixation count, blink duration, saccade velocity, and peak saccade amplitude showed a partial relationship with the mental workload.},

  abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disability with atypical traits in behavioral and physiological responses. These atypical traits in individuals with ASD may be too subtle and subjective to measure visually using tedious methods of scoring. Alternatively, the use of intrusive sensors in the measurement of psychophysical responses in individuals with ASD may likely cause inhibition and bias. This work proposes a novel experimental protocol for non-intrusive sensing and analysis of facial expression, visual scanning, and eye-hand coordination to investigate behavioral markers for ASD. An institutional review board (IRB) approved pilot study is conducted to collect the response data from two groups of subjects (ASD and Control) while they engage in tasks of visualization, recognition, and manipulation. For the first time in the ASD literature, the facial action coding system (FACS) is used to classify spontaneous facial responses. Statistical analyses reveal significantly (p&#x003C;0.01) higher prevalence of smile expression for the group with ASD with the eye-gaze significantly averted (p&#x003C;0.05) from viewing the face in the visual stimuli. This uncontrolled manifestation of smile without proper visual engagement suggests an impairment in reciprocal social communication, e.g., social smile. The group with ASD also reveals poor correlation in eye-gaze and hand movement data suggesting deficits in motor coordination while performing a dynamic manipulation task. The simultaneous sensing and analysis of multimodal response data may provide useful quantitative insights into ASD to facilitate early detection of symptoms for effective intervention planning.},

  abstract  = {This study addresses the need for a theoretical base to develop more effective early autism spectrum disorders (ASD) detection tools. The structure that underlies early ASD detection is explored by evaluating the opinions of experts on ASD screening tools currently used in Europe. A process of face and content validity was performed. First, the best constructs were selected from the relevant tests: Checklist for Early Signs of Developmental Disorders (CESDD), Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT), Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire (ESAT), Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) and Communication and Symbolic Behaviour Scales Developmental Profile (CSBS-DP). The diagnostic content validity model by Fehring (1986, 1994) was adapted to make the selection. Afterwards, the items, taken from these tests, were selected to fit into each construct, using the same methodology. Twelve of the 18 constructs were selected by the experts and 11 items were chosen from a total of 130, reduced to eight after eliminating tautologies. Mapping these constructs and items on to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ASD indicated good face and content validity. Results of this research will contribute to efforts to improve early ASD screening instruments and identify the key behaviours that experts in ASD see as the most relevant for early detection.},

  abstract = {Abstract Impairments in visual motion perception and use of visual motion information to guide behavior have been reported in autism, but the brain alterations underlying these abnormalities are not well characterized. We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to investigate neural correlates of impairments related to visual motion processing. Sixteen high-functioning individuals with autism and 14 age and IQ-matched typically developing individuals completed two fMRI tasks using passive viewing to examine bottom-up responses to visual motion and visual pursuit tracking to assess top-down modulation of visual motion processing during sensorimotor control. The autism group showed greater activation and faster hemodynamic decay in ARMENIAN SMALL LETTER ECH] during the passive viewing task and reduced frontal and ARMENIAN SMALL LETTER ECH] activation during visual pursuit. The observations of increased ARMENIAN SMALL LETTER ECH] activation and its faster decay during passive viewing suggest alterations in local ARMENIAN SMALL LETTER ECH] circuitries that may be associated with reduced GABAergic tone and inhibitory modulation. Reduced frontal and ARMENIAN SMALL LETTER ECH] activation during active pursuit suggest reduced top-down modulation of sensory processing. These results suggest that both local intrinsic abnormalities in ARMENIAN SMALL LETTER ECH] and more widely distributed network level abnormalities are associated with visual motion processing in autism.

Children with autism were significantly less accurate at color memory and search than controls. In experiment 2, chromatic discrimination and categorical perception of color were assessed using a target detection task. Children with autism were less accurate than controls at detecting chromatic targets when presented on chromatic backgrounds, although were equally as fast when target detection was accurate. The strength of categorical perception of color did not differ for the two groups. Implications for theories on perceptual development in autism are discussed. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Early identification of children with ASDs is a critical aspect for the management and treatment of this clinical condition. The aim of this study was the development of a tool for the improvement of the early diagnosis. This paper describes the design and development of this system, which overcomes screening performed with qualitative methods, integrating, in one software a basic patient data record, an audio/video data acquisition system, an editor for the creation of customized tests, a reporting system and an environment for test compilation. Finally, the system also provides interfaces allowing the analysis of the audio signals, such as infant crying, and the perceptual analysis of movements.},

This article reviews this progress, including recent innovations, focussing on those instruments for which the strongest research data on validity exists, and then addresses issues arising from their use in clinical settings. Findings: Research studies have evaluated the ability of screens to prospectively identify cases of ASD in population-based and clinically referred samples, as well as the accuracy of diagnostic instruments to map onto ‘gold standard’ clinical best estimate diagnosis. However, extension of the findings to clinical services must be done with caution, with a full understanding that instrument properties are sample-specific. Furthermore, we are limited by the lack of a true test for ASD which remains a behaviourally defined disorder. In addition, screening and diagnostic instruments help clinicians least in the cases where they are most in want of direction, as their accuracy will always be lower for marginal cases. Conclusion: Instruments help clinicians to collect detailed, structured information and increase accuracy and reliability of referral for in-depth assessment and recommendations for support, but further research is needed to refine their effective use in clinical settings.},

  abstract  = {The rise of accessible commercial eye-tracking systems has fueled a rapid increase in their use in psychological and psychiatric research. By providing a direct, detailed and objective measure of gaze behavior, eye-tracking has become a valuable tool for examining abnormal perceptual strategies in clinical populations and has been used to identify disorder-specific characteristics(1), promote early identification(2), and inform treatment(3). In particular, investigators of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have benefited from integrating eye-tracking into their research paradigms(4-7). Eye-tracking has largely been used in these studies to reveal mechanisms underlying impaired task performance(8) and abnormal brain functioning(9), particularly during the processing of social information(1,10-11). While older children and adults with ASD comprise the preponderance of research in this area, eye-tracking may be especially useful for studying young children with the disorder as it offers a non-invasive tool for assessing and quantifying early-emerging developmental abnormalities(2,12-13). Implementing eye-tracking with young children with ASD, however, is associated with a number of unique challenges, including issues with compliant behavior resulting from specific task demands and disorder-related psychosocial considerations. In this protocol, we detail methodological considerations for optimizing research design, data acquisition and psychometric analysis while eye-tracking young children with ASD. The provided recommendations are also designed to be more broadly applicable for eye-tracking children with other developmental disabilities. By offering guidelines for best practices in these areas based upon lessons derived from our own work, we hope to help other investigators make sound research design and analysis choices while avoiding common pitfalls that can compromise data acquisition while eye-tracking young children with ASD or other developmental difficulties.},

After correcting data, the identification border with density function of the distribution, cumulative frequency function, and ROC curve was set. With this, the objective index to determine autism, normal, false positive, and false negative was established. Furthermore, after analyzing the data in a two-dimensional coordinate, difference between the autism group and the normal developing group became clear. There were few differences in children who are on the borderline between autistic and non-autistic comparing with normal developing children when we validated with the fixation. However, the identification border could be detected definitely in pursuit. It was revealed that this inspection technique to capture eyeball movements by afterimage could detect disorders of sociability clearly and easily. In many educational institutions, this method can be used to evaluate learning and curative effects in future.},

  abstract = {Some studies suggest that individuals with autism present abnormal saccadic eye movements due to an altered strategy for exploration of the surrounding environment. In this study, potential early abnormalities of saccadic movements were explored in 14 male children with autism (5- to 12-year-olds) and in 20 age matched normal males. Only one patient showed clear abnormalities of the "main sequence"; all the other patients, although showing slight changes in saccadic eye movements, did not present classic deficits. Therefore our results did not confirm the presence of saccadic movement alterations in the early stage of autism. Nonetheless, tracts of saccadic initiation failure, continuous changes in saccadic velocity profiles, and instability of fixation were often observed in the autistic population. These findings could be the expression of an early brainstem impairment in autism.},

  abstract = {Based on clinical observations of abnormal gaze behavior of autistic children, it has been suggested that autistic children have a problem in processing social information. Several studies on eye movements have indeed found indications that children with autism show particularly abnormal gaze behavior in relation to social stimuli. However, the methodology used in such investigations did not allow for precise gaze analysis. In the present study, the looking behavior of autistic children toward cartoon-like scenes that included a human figure was measured quantitatively using an infrared eye-tracking device. Fixation behavior of autistic children was similar to that of their age- and IQ-matched normal peers. These results do not support the notion that autistic children have a specific problem in processing socially loaded visual stimuli. Also, there is no indication for an abnormality in gaze behavior in relation to neutral objects. It is suggested that the often-reported abnormal use of gaze in everyday life is not related to the nature of the visual stimuli but that other factors, like social interaction, may play a decisive role.},

The oculomotor system is a sensorimotor network that can provide insights into functional neurobiology and has well-established methodologies for investigation. In this study, we assessed oculomotor performance among children with high functioning ASD and typically developing children, ages 6–12 years. Children with ASD exhibited greater horizontal saccade latency and greater phase lag during vertical smooth pursuit. Saccades and smooth pursuit are mediated by spatially distant brain regions and the long-fiber tracts connecting them, many of which are implicated in ASD. Training paradigms for oculomotor deficits have shown positive outcomes in other clinical populations, and deficits described here may provide useful targets for interventions.},

A novel approach to visual stimuli design is suggested and evaluated. Accurate estimation of the linear dynamics requires sufficient input frequency excitation, while the identification of the nonlinear part is dependent upon the signal amplitude distribution. Both aspects of input design are taken into account. Visual stimuli generated using the presented method are shown to yield favorable identification results compared to existing stimuli design techniques in terms of reduced variance of parameter estimates and smaller spread of the parameter clouds pertaining to different individuals. The nonlinear Wiener models of the SPS appear to outperform the linear ones provided the visual stimuli are properly designed.},

Five different performance measures are calculated to investigate different aspects of the algorithm's behavior. The algorithm is compared to the current state-of-the-art (I-VDT and the algorithm in [11]), as well as to annotations by two experts. The proposed algorithm performs considerably better (average Cohen's kappa 0.42) than the I-VDT algorithm (average Cohen's kappa 0.20) and the algorithm in [11] (average Cohen's kappa 0.16), when compared to the experts’ annotations.},

  abstract  = {Eye tracking is a non-invasive procedure to acquire eye-gaze data. The accuracy offered by the new eye tracking technologies gives to physicians and scientists a great opportunity to employ eye trackers to perform quantitative assessment of eye movements for diagnostic and rehabilitation purposes. However, eye trackers do not support physicians in their analysis, as they typically lack specific software solutions tailored to the diseases under investigation. For instance, ophthalmologists need to use eye trackers in tests such as visually guided saccades or smooth pursuit eye movements, while neuropsychiatrists need them in psychological tests to measure attention deficit. The development of a software tool for a specific test cannot be done by physicians (even using the high-level programming frameworks bundled with eye tracker devices) and needs to be carried out by expert computer programmers. Thus, in this paper we propose a general computer system for eye tracker - based investigation, which allows physicians to easily customize experiments in different scenarios without the need of expert computer programmers. To demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the proposed system, we show how it was employed to support the investigation of eye movements for patients affected by a) glycogen storage disease, b) idiopathic congenital nystagmus and c) neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism spectrum disorders.},

Three hypotheses were tested regarding the origins of problems experienced by children with ASD in dynamic situations. The first one stated that the children with ASD have deficient motion perception. The second one stated that children with ASD are deficient in predicting events, and the third one that the roots are to be found in deficient social perception. The results show that the children with ASD tracked moving objects with smooth pursuit and predicted the reappearance of temporarily occluded moving object in the same way as the TD children. Their eye movements, however, revealed deficient social perception. They looked at a video-taped conversation much less than the TD children, they did not predict the onset of the next turn in the conversation, and the fixations on the speakers were shorter. These effects did not appear in a control video with objects taking turns and making sounds in a similar alternating way to the two participants in the conversation.},

  abstract  = {From the first moments of life, typically developing infants perceive social stimuli as relatively more salient than other competing stimuli. Through ongoing cycles of seeking and acting upon such stimuli, infants transform their understanding of the social world, leading to increasingly refined social abilities and specialized brain circuitry for social processing. By contrast, diminished interest in a wide variety of adaptive social stimuli is a pervasive, early emerging, and enduring feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Reduced attention to such stimuli exerts a compounding influence on development as a child with ASD fails to accrue an increasingly longer list of social experiences that would otherwise play a foundational role in social development and functional brain specialization. In this chapter, we review the canalizing role of preferential attention to social stimuli on behavior and brain development in typical infancy. We also review what is known about the early development of infants who are later diagnosed with ASD, with a focus on early departures from normative developmental trajectories of social visual engagement. We focus primarily on visual attention to the eyes of others as a paradigmatic example of an early emerging foundational social ability, that, when disrupted, is both a marker of emerging social disability and a compounding influence on subsequent development. Finally, we examine the accumulative consequences of departures from normative developmental trajectories of social visual engagement, as children with ASD develop increasingly greater specialization in things other than the social world.},

To examine age-related changes in smooth pursuit tracking.
Method
Using infrared occulography, smooth pursuit eye movements are examined in 53 normal 7− to 15-year-old children during 6° and 12°/second visual pursuit. In addition to smooth pursuit gain and saccadic frequency, measures of mean amplitude per second are introduced to facilitate comparison across age and target speed.
Results
The 6°/second task is found to be easier than the 12°/second task. Age is correlated with smooth pursuit system performance but not saccadic system performance during 12°/second pursuit. No measure correlates with age during 6°/second pursuit.
Conclusions
Eye movements improve as children age. The future use of smooth pursuit eye movements to study children and adolescents with and at risk for schizophrenia must control for developmental changes.},
